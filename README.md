# entropy_reveal
Unlock the secrets of your files with Entropy Reveal. From documents to executables and zipped archives, measure their unpredictability and complexity instantly. Discover hidden patterns and anomalies with entropy analysis. Explore your data's true nature effortlessly.

Features

Entropy Calculation: Computes the Shannon entropy of the file's byte distribution.
Entropy Percentage: Converts the entropy value into a percentage relative to the maximum possible entropy for a byte (8 bits).
User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface for inputting file paths and viewing results.
Entropy Evaluation: Classifies entropy percentages into categories (low, medium, high) with recommendations.
Supports Various File Types: Handles binary files, including compressed (e.g., ZIP) and executable files.

Usage
Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system.

Run the Script:

    python entropy_calculator.py

Evaluation Guide

Low Entropy (Less than 50%): The data in the file shows low randomness and may be less concerning.
Medium Entropy (50% to 80%): The data has moderate randomness and may warrant further investigation.
High Entropy (More than 80%): The data shows high randomness, suggesting potential concerns or unusual content.

Notes

Ensure the file path provided is correct and accessible.
The tool uses the Shannon entropy formula to compute entropy based on byte frequencies.
Results may vary depending on the content and structure of the file.
